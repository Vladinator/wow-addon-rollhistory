RollHistory
==================
Wish that the loot history could get more integrated into your roll frames? This addon modifies the default roll frames and adds counters on the need, greed, disenchant and pass button regarding who picked what choice. A simple list with names over who picked what and over the undecided rollers is shown when hover over the buttons. No configuration required; works out of the box!
